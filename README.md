What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
    - Realizing that if I wanted to display all the info I wanted to originally I would have to go through 2 APIs. It wasnt until later in the
    development process that I realized the first pull of the API I chose didnt have descriptions for the pokemon. This could have saved time and effort.
Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
    - Late in the process I realized some pokemon descriptions weren't in english and I had difficulty figuring out how to get everyones english
    description.
What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
    - I would find a way to get the english descriptions for pokemon.
    - Add stats, abilities, their shiny forms alongside their original look.
Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
    - Take a deeper dive into documentation to save time and effort when looking to pull info.
    - Continue to focus on function over features. Make sure the base works the way I want it to before focusing on features.




## Rubric
Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application’s content and features. ✔
Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.✔
Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. ✔
Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.
Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.).✔
Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.✔
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).✔
Commit frequently to the git repository.✔
Include a README file that contains a description of your application. ✔
Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
